In developing the news media web application, our methodology seamlessly blended frontend and backend technologies to deliver a comprehensive and user-centric platform. Starting with the frontend, HTML and CSS were employed for intuitive design, and React.js facilitated dynamic user interactions. Concurrently, the backend, built on Node.js and Express, featured an SQLite database for efficient data management. Authentication and authorization were implemented using JWT and bcrypt, ensuring secure user access. Real-time updates were integrated through WebSockets, enabling instant dissemination of information. Pagination and filtering enhanced data retrieval efficiency. Our development approach prioritized scalability, maintainability, and compliance with security standards. Rigorous testing and documentation complemented the development cycle, providing a robust foundation for a seamless, responsive, and secure news media web application.
