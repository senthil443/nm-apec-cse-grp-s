In developing the backend for the news media web application, we adopted a systematic approach to ensure efficiency and security. We initiated the process by setting up an Express.js server to manage HTTP interactions, laying the foundation for robust backend functionality. The integration of an SQLite database facilitated the storage and retrieval of news articles and user data, providing a structured foundation for the application.

To enhance user experience and maintain data integrity, we implemented comprehensive CRUD operations, allowing for seamless management of news articles. Real-time updates were incorporated through WebSockets with socket.io, enabling instantaneous dissemination of information to connected clients upon modifications to the news data.

Security was a paramount consideration in our methodology. User authentication was established using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), coupled with bcrypt for secure password storage. User roles were defined, and authorization middleware was implemented, ensuring role-based access control and safeguarding sensitive functionalities.

To optimize data retrieval and enhance user interactions, we introduced pagination and filtering mechanisms. These features empower users to navigate through the news content efficiently, providing a more tailored and responsive experience.

This backend methodology reflects a holistic and thoughtful approach, encompassing fundamental CRUD operations, real-time capabilities, user authentication and authorization, and mechanisms for efficient data retrieval. The resulting backend architecture lays the groundwork for a scalable, secure, and user-centric news media web application.
